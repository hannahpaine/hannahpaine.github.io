/* This is a multi line JS comment - "block"*/
// This is a single line comment - don't need to close it

//alert($);
//$ symbol = jQuery shortcut - whenever referenced, means we are using jQuery
// This is an alert box so that we can see jQuery is running if it wasn't saved as comment
// Every JS code ends in a semicolon;
// If you make a mistake in JS, none of the code will run
// Brackets can't overlap, they need to be nested
// JS never has spaces in - uses camelCase
// when you use = once on it's own, you are assigning value in a variable
// when you use == you are asking js a question
//.on('keyDown') means when a button is pressed 
//.on('change') is when the box changes (text)

// Variables
// 'var' in JS is a variable and it makes the js store the data in front of the variable
// an empty variable is 'null' i.e. if you haven't defined the value
// NAME VALUE TYPE
// name 'Hannah' string
// blah null undefined
/* Data types 
- strings (text inside '' or "" but you can't use the same type of delimiter within the quote)
- numbers
- Boolean - true and false statements e.g. isFemale true boolean
*/

// Comparisons
// Equality comparisons - is something equal to something? This returns a boolean response
/* There are the following comparisons:
== equal to (compares a value)
=== exactly equal to (compares value and type)
!= is not equal to
!== is not equal to (again for value and type - so any text)
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
&& is 'AND' - both variables must be true for the code to run
|| is 'OR' - only one needs to be true for the statement to be satisfied
